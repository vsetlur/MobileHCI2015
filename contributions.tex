The main contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item In a two-week diary study, we learned that most of the difficulty mobile search users experienced occurred during imprecise or general (browsing) searches.  
\item We designed the \textit{GraphTiles} system, supporting imprecise and general searches on mobile devices.
\item In a controlled experiment, we demonstrated that users were able to perform imprecise searches more quickly with \textit{GraphTiles} than with a standard mobile website.
\end{itemize}
