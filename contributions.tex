The main contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Examining the prevalence of mobile search use cases in a two-week diary study. By categorizing the different facets of the search behavior in the study, we identify problems that the participants encountered, particularly around imprecise, open queries. 
\item Implementing a system specifically designed to support open, imprecise and near miss mobile searches. 
\item Evaluation and findings of how well mobile users find information using GraphTiles vs. a standard mobile website, and implications for design of such systems to better support mobile search.
\end{itemize}
