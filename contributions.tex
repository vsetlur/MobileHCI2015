The main contributions of this paper are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Examining the prevalence of mobile search use cases in a two-week diary study. By categorizing the different facets of the search behavior in the study, we identify problems that the participants encountered, particularly around imprecise, open queries. 
\item Implementing a system called `GraphTiles' specifically designed to support open, imprecise and near miss mobile searches for both bipartite and non-bipartite information neighborhoods.
\item Performed two experiments - one to evaluate how well mobile users find information using GraphTiles vs. a standard mobile website, and the other to evaluate various explicit link representations in non-bipartite information graphs.
\end{itemize}
